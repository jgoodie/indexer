python FS indexer

### PROTOTYPE
specifically to "scan" a file system for eBooks and documents
use NLP to summarize and get topics
use apache TIKA
store data into SQLite and use fast text search

### Containerize and REST API
once the prototype is working containerize it. 
switch from SQLite to Postgres or something else? SQLlite is portable is a pro
REST API to query

### Build a UI
big questions here
which framework? Node? 

### Other
how much overlap with MR?
can this be used by MR?
