are?00:06:03 Speaker 1You trying build story?00:06:05 Speaker 1Some people like tell liZle bit managing your.Close essence, backlog.00:06:09 Speaker 2Yeah so.00:06:10 Speaker 100:06:12 Speaker 2Yeah I do.00:06:13 Speaker 2I I I started it.00:06:15 Speaker 2I thought in.00:06:17 Speaker 2What call Azure?00:06:20 Speaker 1No teams whatever know.00:06:21 Speaker 2And whatever think.00:06:22 Speaker 100:06:30 Speaker 2You know operaUon liZle.00:06:31 Speaker 2Bit overkill, but.00:06:32 Speaker 200:06:38 Speaker 2Technical foundaUon ﬁrst.00:06:40 Speaker 2You know, think about.00:06:41 Speaker 2A game got a.00:06:43 Speaker 2The Visual Studio FoundaUon server, yeah.00:06:25 Speaker 2Yes, yeah, whatever called now, I I decided one person.Uhm, aﬀecUvely, I've I decided I wanted go a]er.Basically engine, game itself, like assets and.00:06:48 Speaker 200:06:50 Speaker 2And whatnot make game unique, right?Well, building S, engine.00:06:53 Speaker 2I can't take unity unreal something.00:06:54 Speaker 2That's like use build.00:06:57 Speaker 2So build build everything.00:06:59 Speaker 2So I build, know, I'm plaform Mario Castlevania type game, I build, youknow, physics collision detecUon know kind stuﬀ ground up.My ﬁrst objecUve make a.00:07:10 Speaker 2So ﬁrst.00:07:12 Speaker 200:07:14 Speaker 2List all.00:07:15 Speaker 200:07:20 Speaker 200:07:26 Speaker 2Game gonna going like.00:07:28 Speaker 200:07:37 Speaker 2So I built ﬁrst.00:07:38 Speaker 200:07:43 Speaker 2Of basic foundaUonal capabiliUes game would need even without a.Story like plot uh, know, even kind details far like what's this?A lot I pushed decisions oﬀ later I knew I wanted plaformer gameand I knew plaformers require basic capabiliUes.And I started brainstorming wife, actually, 'cause helping think through.What types capabiliUes, technical capabiliUes need able expand into?I've goZen like core foundaUon I'm onto second set foundaUonal things.Is make game liZle bit unique, third thing content like I've got theengine creaUng speciﬁc maps speciﬁc enemy sprites speciﬁc know allthe things make game look feel way does, I really can't Ull a]er I've builtthe underlying engine controls works.Do what's makes game unique, right?You know what?00:07:44 Speaker 200:07:49 Speaker 200:07:52 Speaker 2So I'd say I'm I'm.00:07:54 Speaker 200:08:00 Speaker 2Well, believe not, complete you.00:08:20 Speaker 2Like this?00:08:21 Speaker 100:08:25 Speaker 1Yeah whole thing.00:08:26 Speaker 1I mean may.00:08:27 Speaker 1Be here, have.00:08:29 Speaker 100:08:30 Speaker 2Yeah, more.00:08:31 Speaker 2It's I have.00:08:33 Speaker 2A whole project plan instead money.I'm sort wriZen down, not, again, I'm using OneNote.You know, a, list, know I need one person.Alright, exciUng honest.I it.00:08:34 Speaker 200:08:36 Speaker 200:08:41 Speaker 1That's preZy cool.00:08:41 Speaker 1That's preZy damn cool.00:08:42 Speaker 100:08:46 Speaker 1I I'm I'm impressed.00:08:48 Speaker 1That's super

liZle bit about.What perspecUve believe biggest challenge product manager?Well, I'm sure biggest, I'll start comes top head.A lot Ume eﬀort spent trying understand.Are really trying accomplish like what?00:09:50 Speaker 2Measurable thing going to?00:09:06 Speaker 100:09:10 Speaker 100:09:17 Speaker 100:09:26 Speaker 2The biggest challenge?00:09:30 Speaker 200:09:35 Speaker 2I feel like.00:09:37
