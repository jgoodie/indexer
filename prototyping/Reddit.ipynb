       "\"You should be careful not to read too much into this. Though perfection is the enemy, a unusable product and improper positioning is also a failure.\\n\\nMany have said that use MVP to find P/M fit so that you can learn from faster iterations. I absolutely agree but building MVP is difficult because you have to make some hard decisions on what makes the cut vs what doesn't. Some basic principles I use for MVP are\\n\\n1. day 1 vs day 2 features. For MVP, focus on subset of day 1 features\\n2. single use case vs multiple use cases. For MVP, start with the critical single use case that aligns with your messaging\\n3. For MVP, invest in onboarding the attractive segment that are receptive to your messaging\\n4. Ignore scale related initiatives until you have reached stickiness with your first segment. For e.g. usability at scale, product performance at scale and so on aren't that important with MVP.\\n5. Design a vertical slice that covers end to end use case such that the use case is usable, functional, delightful and reliable. \\n6. Have tight feedback loops with the power users. Build in ways to submit feedback, establish triage and prioritization process for bugs/feature requests etc.\\n7. Instrument to capture your success metrics/counter metrics. Use tools like Amplitude to learn about your users and their behaviors.\\n8. Assuming you have proper instrumentation/tools, analyze your retention (and it's flip side - churn) - Who are sticking/leaving, when are they leaving, what are the attributes of users (and actions they take) that stick around and so on. You're continuously analyzing, synthesizing and sharing your cohort analysis.\""

      "\" Let me preface this by saying I have been a PM at Microsoft for the past 11 years where I have led massive teams and literally made the company billions of dollars and another 8 years of product experience at various startups before that, including my own which was acquired by Microsoft.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a year ago, I had a record number of recruiters reaching out on LinkedIn and for the first time in a decade, I decided to actually take some interviews as the market was getting red hot. I got rejected after the first or second round everywhere--Snap, Google, Facebook, Stripe, you name it. I know I am a stellar Product Manager and all my performance evals and promotion history at Microsoft solidly back that up.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the interview feedback I consistently got was that my responses weren‚Äôt structured enough or that I had missed covering things in my response that weren‚Äôt explicitly asked about. Or worse, I would get useless hypothetical questions like ‚ÄúCome up with the business strategy for an invisibility cloak‚Äù which just felt like PMs at Google in their mid-20s were trying to amuse themselves at the expense of my interview experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, I decided to recruit again but instead of winging it, I spent nights and weekends for an entire month prepping. I completed the full Product Alliance course, wrote out 20 different stories I could use for various behavioral questions, did some paid mocks with PMs at the some companies I was targeting, etc. This time around, I got offers from everywhere I interviewed (Facebook, Google, Coinbase, Apple, Rivian and Uber) with the sole exception of Stripe.\n",
      "\n",
      "My realization was nothing had really changed in me as a candidate between the 1 year where I got rejected and then accepted at a lot of the same companies. There is just an artificial barrier we have put up around preparing frameworks, structures and canned stories in order to progress our careers. If you haven‚Äôt spent at least 40-50 hours prepping, you realistically won‚Äôt get offers at any top companies despite having awesome credentials. What‚Äôs worse, is the questions you get asked in PM interviews do extremely little to establish that you‚Äôd actually be a good Product Manager. Like estimation questions in particular are largely useless imo; however, unless you have learned the preferred structure for answering estimation questions, you won't get the job offer where you'd actually be working a very specific project that‚Äôs already been market sized and is going to ship regardless of your ability to do back of the envelope calculations on the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôm not sure where I am going with this. I just feel like the current FAANG PM interview process just tests if you have studied rather than if you are actually a good PM. I shouldn‚Äôt have to take a 30 hour course to pass PM interviews when I have nearly two decades of experience. I think the current state of product management interviews is completely broken and it's gonna lead to the wrong people taking the product reins at a lot of the current top companies if it doesn‚Äôt change. Companies are explicitly prioritizing candidate's willingness to cram for interviews over actual product experience, references, etc which I think is a big mistake.\n",
